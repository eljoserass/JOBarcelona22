# JOBarcelona22
Repo with my submissions for the data science challenge
# next steps:
- apply k means with k=3 and assing the tags of the clusters to the insect type
- save model. with centroids.
- look how to use with tensorlow new inputs to assign new points to its insect type. if not, just measure the distance between each cluster and the input point and assign it to the nearest.
- create new pd data frame adding to the test_data set the insect type, save it as result.
- check for errors in the result and improve the algorithm if possible.
- celebrate because it is done B)
