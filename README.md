# JOBarcelona22
Repo with my submissions for the data science challenge
# next steps:
- append results to the train_file.csv, remember to transorm time in minutes and then put it as it was
- test with supervised learning algorithm differents than the knn
- write good readme about how to install the project
- create classes main and folder to specify the dependencies to train and the src
- maybe create loaded version of .sav file that will predict when you put the input file of the prediction
- write the prediction by creating a file that is called 'results.csv' and will have the index of the row and the prediction
